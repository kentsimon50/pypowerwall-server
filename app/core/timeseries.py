"""
TimeSeriesStore - Lightweight SQLite-backed time-series storage.

Persists raw 5-second power samples from the existing poll loop and derives
daily energy totals (kWh) per gateway via trapezoidal integration. Survives
restarts, adds no network calls, and can be disabled entirely for headless
proxy deployments (PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION=-1).

Architecture:
    Two-layer storage keeps the on-disk footprint tiny by default:

    1. Raw samples (table ``samples``) - one row per gateway per poll cycle
       (~17k rows/day at the default 5s interval). Power readings are split
       into directional components at record time (battery charge/discharge,
       grid import/export) so no information is netted away. Pruned to the
       PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION window by a background maintenance task.

    2. Daily aggregates (table ``daily_energy``) - one row per gateway per
       local day holding cumulative kWh per category. This is the layer that
       outlives raw-sample pruning: a full year of daily totals is ~1 KB per
       gateway. Retention governed by PW_TIMESERIES_DAILY_RETENTION.

    A third table (``integration_state``) stores the last integrated sample
    per gateway so energy accumulation resumes exactly where it left off
    after a restart, without double counting.

Device signals (Powerwall temperatures and fans):
    Per-device readings (battery pack max/min, shunt and inverter ambient
    temperatures; fan speed and duty cycle) are stored as generic series so
    a new signal needs only an entry in SIGNAL_METRICS (app/core/signals.py),
    no schema change:

    - ``device_series``  one row per (gateway, device block, metric), e.g.
      ("default", "TEPOD--1707000-11-J--TG1...", "pack_temp_max"). Units
      and labels come from SIGNAL_METRICS, not the table.
    - ``device_samples`` (series_id, ts, value), recorded at most every
      PW_TIMESERIES_SIGNAL_INTERVAL (default 60s; 30s minimum for finer
      detail) and pruned to PW_TIMESERIES_SIGNAL_RETENTION (default 30d).
    - ``device_daily``   per series per gateway-local day: min, max, sum and
      count (so the mean), kept like daily_energy under
      PW_TIMESERIES_DAILY_RETENTION. Long-range history reads this table.

    At 60s a Powerwall 3 records 8 series (~11.5k rows/day, roughly
    0.4 MB/day on disk), so the 30-day default stays around 12 MB per unit.
    30s (the minimum) doubles that (~24 MB).

Energy integration:
    Trapezoidal integration between consecutive samples:
        kWh = (P0 + P1) / 2 * dt / 3_600_000   (P in watts, dt in seconds)

    - Intervals longer than the 1-hour gap threshold are NOT integrated
      (stale/outage data must not fabricate energy).
    - Intervals crossing local midnight (in the gateway's configured
      timezone) are split at the boundary so each day accrues only its own
      energy. DST transitions are handled naturally because integration is
      performed on real elapsed time; only day attribution uses local dates.

Thread safety:
    Two lanes, both off the event loop:
    - Writer lane: recording, daily rollups, integration state, pruning
      and the /today totals run on one worker thread
      (ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1, thread_name_prefix="timeseries"))
      with the read-write connection, serialized by an RLock.
    - Read lane: the API queries (/daily, /trend, /samples, /signals,
      /signal_trend and the /status counts) run on a second worker thread
      ("timeseries-read") with a read-only connection
      (file:...?mode=ro), guarded by its own lock. The lane takes the
      writer's RLock only once, when it first opens, so the writer can
      create the database and tables; after that queries never take it,
      and WAL mode lets them read while the writer writes, so a long
      history query can't delay recording.
    For ":memory:" databases (tests), when WAL can't be enabled (a reader
    would then block the writer's commits), or if a read-only open fails,
    queries fall back to the writer lane (logged once at warning). Query
    sizes stay bounded (raw signal reads switch to daily rollups), which
    keeps reads short and WAL checkpoints moving.
    After stop(), recording is a no-op and queries return their empty
    results without reopening connections or threads.

Environment Variables:
    PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION       Raw sample retention (default "24h").
                                  Duration suffixes: s/m/h/d/w.
                                  "0" = unlimited, "-1" = disable subsystem
                                  entirely (no SQLite file, no UI panel).
    PW_TIMESERIES_DAILY_RETENTION Daily aggregate retention (default "0" =
                                  unlimited). One row/day/gateway is tiny,
                                  so unlimited is a sensible default.
    PW_TIMESERIES_SIGNAL_RETENTION
                                  Device signal (temperature/fan) sample
                                  retention (default "30d"). "0" = unlimited,
                                  "-1" = do not record device signals.
    PW_TIMESERIES_SIGNAL_INTERVAL Minimum seconds between device signal
                                  samples per gateway (default "60s").
    PW_TIMESERIES_PATH            SQLite file path (default "/data/timeseries.db"
                                  when /data exists — e.g. the Docker image —
                                  otherwise "data/timeseries.db" relative to
                                  the working directory). If set to a
                                  directory instead of a file (trailing "/"
                                  or an existing directory), "timeseries.db"
                                  is appended automatically.
