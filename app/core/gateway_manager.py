"""
Gateway Manager - Manages connections to multiple Powerwall gateways.

This is the central hub of the server that manages all pypowerwall connections,
performs background polling, caches data, and provides fast API responses.

Architecture:
    - Singleton pattern (single gateway_manager instance)
    - Background polling every PW_CACHE_EXPIRE seconds (default: 5s)
    - One independent poll task per gateway (slow gateways don't delay others)
    - Cached data for instant API responses without blocking
    - Automatic reconnection on failure

Connection Modes:
    TEDAPI (Local Gateway):
        pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(
            host="192.168.91.1",
            gw_pwd="gateway_wifi_password",
            timeout=3
        )
    
    Cloud Mode:
        pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(
            email="user@example.com",
            authpath="/path/to/auth/files",
            cloudmode=True
        )
    
    FleetAPI:
        pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(
            email="user@example.com",
            authpath="/path/to/auth/files",
            fleetapi=True
        )

Data Flow:
    1. Background task calls _poll_gateway() for each gateway every N seconds
    2. _poll_gateway() makes blocking pypowerwall calls in executor with timeouts
    3. Results cached in self.cache[gateway_id] as GatewayStatus objects
    4. API endpoints read from cache (instant response, no blocking)
    5. Failed polls update gateway status to offline (automatic retry next cycle)

Error Handling:
    - Connection failures logged but don't crash server
    - Timeouts on pypowerwall calls (3-10s depending on operation)
    - Offline gateways excluded from aggregates
    - Cached data remains available during outages
    - Automatic reconnection every poll cycle

Thread Safety:
    - All operations use asyncio (no threads/locks needed for reads)
    - Write operations serialized via _write_lock to prevent set_operation() races
    - Single event loop handles all concurrency
    - Background task coordinated via asyncio.create_task()
    - Graceful shutdown via task cancellation

Performance:
    - Concurrent gateway polling for speed
    - Short timeouts prevent blocking
    - Cached responses for instant API access
    - Minimal memory footprint (only latest data cached)
