"""
MQTT Publisher — pushes Powerwall telemetry to an MQTT broker.

Enabled by setting MQTT_HOST in environment (see app/config.py for full variable list).
When MQTT_HOST is not set this module is completely inert — no imports of aiomqtt
happen, no background task is started, and no code paths in the poll loop are changed.

Architecture
------------
A single long-running asyncio task (_connection_loop) maintains a persistent
connection to the broker with automatic reconnect and exponential backoff.
After each successful gateway poll, gateway_manager calls:

    asyncio.create_task(mqtt_publisher.publish_gateway(gateway_id, status))

The task is fire-and-forget: MQTT failures are logged at DEBUG level and never
propagate back to the poll loop, so HTTP API reliability is unaffected.

Thread safety
-------------
The publisher runs entirely within the asyncio event loop.  No threading locks
are required because all state mutations happen from coroutines (single thread).
The _connected flag and _client reference are read/written only from coroutines.

Reconnect strategy
------------------
The connection loop uses exponential backoff: 2 s, 4 s, 8 s … capped at 60 s.
On each successful publish failure, _connected is set to False; the connection
loop detects this on its next 5-second heartbeat and tears down the context
manager, triggering the outer reconnect logic.

    Per-unit device signals (Powerwall temperatures and fan speeds, from

    {prefix}/{gateway_id}/devices/{serial}                          JSON  — full per-unit signals
    Only the signals each unit reports are published - a PW2 unit gets fan
    rpm but no duty, and an expansion pack gets pack temps but no fans.

    Remote-meter lifetime energy is converted from Tesla's watt-seconds to
    whole Wh; the per-CT JSON includes Location ("site" / "solar" / "load").

    Tesla Remote Meter: a wireless CT meter (config.json type "trm_mb").
    {din} is the meter's own device identifier; {n} is the CT index (a meter
    can report more than one CT, and a gateway can have more than one meter).
    Sourced from pw.vitals()'s TRM--<din> blocks (pypowerwall >= 0.18.2 in
    TEDAPI modes; Basic LAN skips vitals) - absent when no remote meter.
