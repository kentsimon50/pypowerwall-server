Home Assistant MQTT Discovery — builds and publishes auto-discovery payloads.

When MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY=true (default), calling publish_discovery() for a gateway
causes Home Assistant to automatically create a "Powerwall" device with all sensors
grouped under it — no manual YAML configuration needed.

Discovery topics follow the HA convention:
    {ha_prefix}/sensor/pypowerwall_{gateway_id}_{sensor}/config

Each payload is retained so HA re-reads it after restarts.

Sensor catalogue
----------------
Sensors (numeric):
    battery     — Tesla-scaled battery charge (%, device_class=battery)
    battery_raw — Raw battery charge (%)
    solar       — Solar power (W, device_class=power)
    grid        — Grid power (W, device_class=power, positive=importing)
    home        — Home load (W, device_class=power)
    powerwall   — Powerwall power (W, device_class=power, positive=discharging)
    reserve     — Backup reserve target (%)
    total_capacity — Total battery capacity (Wh)
    current_charge — Current battery charge (Wh)

Solar string sensors (when string_ids provided):
    strings/{id}/voltage  — String voltage (V, per string A–F or multi-PW3 A1–F2…)
    strings/{id}/current  — String current (A)
    strings/{id}/power    — String power (W)
    strings/{AB}/voltage  — Paired-string voltage (V, from first string in pair)
    strings/{AB}/current  — Paired-string current (A, sum of pair)
    strings/{AB}/power    — Paired-string power (W, sum of pair)

Remote meter sensors (when remote_meters provided — Tesla wireless CT meters,
config.json type "trm_mb", surfaced by pypowerwall as TRM--<din> vitals blocks):
    meters/remote/{din}/ct{n}/voltage         — CT voltage (V)
    meters/remote/{din}/ct{n}/current         — CT current (A)
    meters/remote/{din}/ct{n}/power           — CT real power (W)
    meters/remote/{din}/ct{n}/energy_imported — CT lifetime energy imported (Wh, total_increasing)
    meters/remote/{din}/ct{n}/energy_exported — CT lifetime energy exported (Wh, total_increasing)

Per-unit device sensors (when device_signals provided — Powerwall temperature
and fan readings from vitals, keyed by unit serial):
    devices/{serial}/temperature/pack_max     — Battery pack max temperature (°C, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/temperature/pack_min     — Battery pack min temperature (°C, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/temperature/shunt        — Shunt temperature (°C, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/temperature/ambient      — Inverter ambient temperature (°C, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/temperature/controller   — Thermal controller temperature (°C, PW2/2+)
    devices/{serial}/fan/a/rpm                — Fan A measured speed (rpm, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/fan/a/duty               — Fan A drive duty cycle (%, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/fan/b/rpm                — Fan B measured speed (rpm, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/fan/b/duty               — Fan B drive duty cycle (%, PW3)
    devices/{serial}/fan/rpm                  — Fan measured speed (rpm, PW2/2+)
    devices/{serial}/fan/target_rpm           — Fan target speed (rpm, PW2/2+)
    Only the signals each unit reports are discovered (a PW2 unit gets no
    fan duty sensors; an expansion pack gets pack temps but no fans).

Lifetime energy sensors (Wh, device_class=energy, state_class=total_increasing):
    grid_energy_imported     — Grid energy imported, lifetime (from aggregates site)
    grid_energy_exported     — Grid energy exported, lifetime (from aggregates site)
    home_energy_imported     — Home energy consumption, lifetime (from aggregates load)
    solar_energy_exported    — Solar energy production, lifetime (from aggregates solar)
    battery_energy_imported  — Battery energy charged, lifetime
    battery_energy_exported  — Battery energy discharged, lifetime

Text sensors:
    grid_status — "UP" | "DOWN" | "unknown"
    mode        — Operation mode string (e.g. "self_consumption", "backup")
    version     — Firmware version string
    grid_export — Grid export policy (battery_ok | pv_only | never)

Binary sensor:
    online      — Gateway connection status
    grid_connected — Grid connected (true when grid_status=="UP", device_class=connectivity)
    grid_charging — Grid charging allowed (true/false, generic On/Off, no device class)

Numeric sensors:
    time_remaining — Backup time remaining (h, device_class=duration)

Controls (MQTT_CONTROLS bitmask + PW_CONTROL_SECRET set, broker-trust;
only bits in the mask are announced — 1 reserve, 2 mode, 4 grid_charging,
8 grid_export, 16 islanding):
    reserve       — number 0-100 % (state reserve)
    mode          — select [self_consumption, backup, autonomous] (state mode)
    grid_charging — switch (state grid_charging)
    grid_export   — select [battery_ok, pv_only, never] (state grid_export)
    islanding     — buttons Go Off Grid / Reconnect Grid
Commands go to {prefix}/{gw}/control/{control}/set.
Reserve, mode and the grid controls are announced only where the gateway can
write them (cloud, FleetAPI, bound hybrid cloud or v1r); islanding only on v1r.

All sensors share a single "Powerwall" device block so HA groups them together.
The device model is set from PowerwallData.version when available, otherwise
"Powerwall".
