## Quick Start

### Requirements

* TEDAPI Mode: For extended metrics you will need the Powerwall/Gateway Password (typically found on the QR sticker - behind front panel of PW3 - see [picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf11830-fa70-4ebb-9be7-7d0a5e2db4dc)). And you computer must be connected to the Powerwall WiFi Access point (it will be IP address 192.168.91.1)
* Basic LAN Mode (PW3): For core metrics over a wired connection, you only need the customer password (last 5 characters of the gateway password) and the Powerwall's wired LAN IP on the vendor subnet (e.g. `10.42.1.x`). See [Basic LAN Mode](#basic-lan-mode-powerwall-3-no-gateway-password-or-rsa-key) below.
* Cloud Mode: For basic metrics, you will need your Tesla customer login credentials (email) and will need to run the cloud mode one-time setup below.


### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the provided Docker image. You can run in either TEDAPI Mode (local access) or Cloud Mode (remote access). Select the appropriate option below:

#### Choosing a Connection Mode

Not sure which mode to run? Pick the row that matches your setup — then follow its example below:

| Mode | Use when | Required settings | Data | Control |
|------|----------|-------------------|------|---------|
| **TEDAPI** *(default)* | You can reach the gateway from your local network (`192.168.91.1`) | `PW_HOST` + `PW_GW_PWD` | Full local metrics — power flows, vitals, strings, per-Powerwall detail | Add `PW_EMAIL` + `PW_AUTH_PATH` for hybrid cloud control |
| **TEDAPI v1r** | Same, but connecting over wired LAN with a registered RSA key | `PW_HOST` + `PW_GW_PWD` + `PW_RSA_KEY_PATH` (add `PW_WIFI_HOST` for follower Powerwall data) | Full local metrics | Authenticated local islanding with `PW_CONTROL_SECRET`; add `PW_EMAIL` + `PW_AUTH_PATH` for other hybrid cloud control |
| **Basic LAN** *(Powerwall 3)* | PW3 reachable on its wired vendor subnet — no gateway password or RSA key needed | `PW_HOST` + `PW_PASSWORD` (customer password = last 5 chars of the gateway password) | Core metrics only — power flows, battery SoC, grid status | Add `PW_EMAIL` + `PW_AUTH_PATH` for hybrid cloud control (local reads + cloud writes) |
| **Cloud** | No local network access to the system | `PW_EMAIL` + `PW_AUTH_PATH` (one-time `python -m pypowerwall setup`) | Standard cloud metrics | Yes |
| **FleetAPI** | Remote access via Tesla's official Fleet API | `PW_GATEWAYS` (or `gateways.yaml`) entry with `email` + `authpath` + `fleetapi: true` | Standard cloud metrics | Yes |

Local v1r and Basic LAN modes can perform supported control operations when `PW_CONTROL_SECRET` is set. Without cloud credentials, `/control/reserve`, `/control/mode`, and `/control/grid_charging` use the gateway's local connection. With `PW_EMAIL` and `PW_AUTH_PATH` configured (hybrid mode), those operations use the cloud connection while monitoring remains local. `POST /control/islanding` is different: it is available only in TEDAPI v1r mode, requires a registered RSA key, always uses the local gateway connection, and does not fall back to cloud control.

#### TEDAPI Mode (Local Access)
```bash
# TEDAPI Mode requires host network to access gateway at 192.168.91.1
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  --network host \
  -e PW_HOST=192.168.91.1 \
  -e PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server
```

#### TEDAPI v1r Mode (RSA Key Auth)
```bash
# TEDAPI v1r uses an RSA-4096 private key for the encrypted channel,
# but still requires PW_GW_PWD to derive the customer password.
# Generate a key pair with pypowerwall, then mount it into the container.
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  --network host \
  -e PW_HOST=192.168.91.1 \
  -e PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password \
  -e PW_RSA_KEY_PATH=/keys/tedapi_rsa_private.pem \
  -e PW_WIFI_HOST=192.168.91.1 \
  -v /path/to/keys:/keys \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server
```

> **Note:** `PW_WIFI_HOST` is the IP address pypowerwall uses for the WiFi fallback path in v1r mode. It defaults to `192.168.91.1`. Only set it if your gateway is on a different IP (e.g. behind a travel router).
>
> **Note:** The `-v pws-data:/data` mount persists the daily energy history (SQLite time-series store) across container upgrades. Omit it if you run with `PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION=-1` (subsystem disabled).

#### Basic LAN Mode (Powerwall 3, No Gateway Password or RSA Key)

Powerwall 3 units expose a small set of local API endpoints over their wired LAN interface (vendor subnet, e.g. `10.42.1.x`). With just the customer password (the last 5 characters of the gateway password), you can monitor core metrics without the gateway Wi-Fi password, an RSA key, or any cloud setup:

```bash
# Basic LAN Mode - connect directly to the Powerwall 3 over Ethernet
# PW_HOST is the Powerwall's wired LAN IP on the vendor subnet
# PW_PASSWORD is the customer password (last 5 chars of the gateway password)
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  --network host \
  -e PW_HOST=<pw3-ip> \
  -e PW_PASSWORD=your_customer_password \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server
```

This mode serves power flows (`/api/meters/aggregates`), battery state of charge (`/api/system_status/soe`), and grid status (`/api/system_status/grid_status`). Most other local `/api/*` endpoints (vitals, strings, operation, firmware info, etc.) return 404 in this mode, so pypowerwall-server skips them automatically to keep the logs clean. Monitoring is read-only and limited to the core metrics — for full device-level data use TEDAPI mode above. Requires `pypowerwall` 0.17.0+.

##### Basic LAN + Cloud Control (Hybrid)

The local Basic LAN connection is read-only. To control your Powerwall from this mode (set reserve level, operating mode, grid charging), add Tesla cloud credentials — monitoring stays on the local connection, control writes go through the Tesla cloud:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  --network host \
  -e PW_HOST=<pw3-ip> \
  -e PW_PASSWORD=your_customer_password \
  -e PW_EMAIL="your@email.com" \
  -e PW_AUTH_PATH=/auth \
  -v ~/.pypowerwall:/auth \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server

# One-time setup (runs the Tesla auth flow to generate the token files)
docker exec -it pypowerwall-server python -m pypowerwall setup
```

Both pieces are required for control: `PW_EMAIL` identifies the Tesla account, and `PW_AUTH_PATH` points at the directory holding the `.pypowerwall.auth` / `.pypowerwall.site` token files created by the one-time setup (email alone is not enough — the cloud connection has no password to log in with). With both set, `/control/reserve`, `/control/mode` and `/control/grid_charging` route through the cloud connection while all monitoring data keeps coming from the local Basic LAN endpoints (no internet needed for reads). The Console shows **Hybrid** as the connect mode and tracks both links separately (`Local` / `Cloud` sub-rows): if the internet drops, the Connection card reads **Degraded** with `Local: Healthy / Cloud: Unavailable` instead of reporting plain health from the local link alone. If the cloud connection can't be established at all, monitoring is unaffected, control requests return an error, and the Console's Powerwall Mode shows `--` (unavailable) rather than a made-up value; when the cloud link drops *after* having been up, the last known mode/reserve are shown marked `(stale)` with their fetch time exposed via `/api/operation`.

#### Cloud Mode (Remote Access)

```bash
# Cloud Mode requires one-time setup using Tesla login step below
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  -p 8675:8675 \
  -v ~/.pypowerwall:/auth \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  -e PW_EMAIL="your@email.com" \
  -e PW_AUTH_PATH=/auth \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server

# One-time setup (runs auth flow to generate token files)
docker exec -it pypowerwall-server python -m pypowerwall setup
```

The PyPowerwall Server will be running at: http://localhost:8675 (if not running local, replace "localhost" with the IP of the host running the container).

### Option: Multiple Powerwalls

```bash
# Multiple local gateways - requires host network
docker run -d \
  --name pypowerwall-server \
  --network host \
  -v pws-data:/data \
  -e PW_GATEWAYS='[
    {"id": "home", "name": "Home Gateway", "host": "192.168.91.1", "gw_pwd": "gateway_password_1"},
    {"id": "cabin", "name": "Cabin Gateway", "host": "192.168.91.2", "gw_pwd": "gateway_password_2"},
    {"id": "garage", "name": "Garage (travel router)", "host": "192.168.1.50", "port": 8443, "gw_pwd": "gateway_password_3"}
  ]' \
  jasonacox/pypowerwall-server
```

### Option: Command Line Test

```bash
# Install
pip install pypowerwall-server

# TEDAPI Mode
pypowerwall-server --host 192.168.91.1 --gw-pwd your_gateway_password

# Multiple Powerwalls
pypowerwall-server --config gateways.yaml

# Cloud Mode
pypowerwall-server --setup # one-time setup
pypowerwall-server --email "your@email.com"
```

## Configuration

> **Note**: Most users will use **TEDAPI** to connect to their Powerwall gateway, which is accessible at the standard IP address `192.168.91.1` on your local network. You'll need your gateway password (found in the Tesla app under your gateway settings).

### Cloud Authentication Setup (Optional, for Control Operations)

If you want to control your Powerwall (set reserve level, operating mode, etc.), you'll need Tesla Cloud authentication:

**One-time setup:**
```bash
pip install pypowerwall-server
pypowerwall-server --setup 
```

This will:
1. Open your browser to authenticate with Tesla
2. Generate `.pypowerwall.auth` and `.pypowerwall.site` token files
3. Store them in the default location or a specified directory

### Environment Variables

**Single Gateway Mode (Read-Only via TEDAPI):**
```bash
PW_HOST=192.168.91.1
PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password
PW_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
PW_PORT=8675              # Default port (proxy-compatible)
PW_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0  # Listen on all interfaces
PROXY_BASE_URL=/pypowerwall  # Optional: serve under a sub-path (see Reverse Proxy)
```

**Single Gateway Mode (TEDAPI v1r — RSA Key Auth):**
```bash
PW_HOST=192.168.91.1
PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password                  # Gateway password (last 5 chars used as customer password)
PW_RSA_KEY_PATH=/path/to/tedapi_rsa_private.pem  # RSA-4096 private key for v1r encrypted channel
PW_WIFI_HOST=192.168.91.1                         # WiFi fallback IP for v1r mode (default: 192.168.91.1)
PW_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
```

**Single Gateway Mode (TEDAPI bearer over wired LAN — solar-only):**
```bash
PW_HOST=192.168.1.50                      # Gateway's LAN IP (not the 192.168.91.1 Wi-Fi AP)
PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password
PW_TEDAPI_AUTH_MODE=bearer                # basic (default, Wi-Fi AP only) | bearer (wired LAN or Wi-Fi)
PW_TEDAPI_API_VERSION=V2026_06            # V2024_06 (default) | V2026_06 (Tesla-signed query set)
PW_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
```
Bearer mode is hardware-verified on solar-only (inverter) gateways over both a Wi-Fi
static route and the wired LAN IP. It is **not** supported on Powerwall 2 or Powerwall 3 —
use `PW_RSA_KEY_PATH` (TEDAPI v1r) for PW3 wired access. `V2026_06` selects pypowerwall's
Tesla-signed query set (needed on firmware that rejects the legacy queries); it requires
`protobuf >= 6.33.6` at runtime — the Docker image resolves this automatically, and a
too-old install is reported at startup with the `pip install` command to run. Both
settings can also be set per gateway (`tedapi_auth_mode`, `tedapi_api_version`) in
`PW_GATEWAYS` / the YAML config, overriding these defaults.

**Single Gateway Mode (With Cloud Control):**
```bash
PW_HOST=192.168.91.1
PW_GW_PWD=your_gateway_password          # For TEDAPI data reads
PW_EMAIL=your-tesla-account@email.com
PW_AUTH_PATH=/path/to/auth/files            # Directory with .pypowerwall.auth/.site
PW_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles
```

**Multi-Gateway Mode:**
```bash
PW_GATEWAYS='[
  {
    "id": "home",
    "name": "Home System", 
    "host": "192.168.91.1",
    "gw_pwd": "gw_pwd_1",
    "email": "tesla@email.com",
    "authpath": "/auth"
  },
  {
    "id": "cabin",
    "name": "Cabin System",
    "host": "192.168.91.1",
    "gw_pwd": "gw_pwd_2",
    "email": "tesla@email.com",
    "authpath": "/auth"
  }
]'
```

**TEDAPI SolarOnly Fallback Recovery:**
```bash
PW_TEDAPI_RECOVERY=yes                     # Enable auto-recovery (default: yes)
PW_TEDAPI_PROBE_INTERVAL=30                # Seconds between TEDAPI health probes (default: 30)
```
When TEDAPI drops mid-session (firmware update, route loss), the server
tracks SolarOnly fallback as a distinct state and retries reconnection with
exponential backoff (60s → 300s max). Fallback state is exposed in `/health`
and `/stats`. `POST /health/reset` clears fallback state (requires
`PW_CONTROL_SECRET`). Only active in TEDAPI mode — no overhead for Cloud/FleetAPI.

**Logging & Diagnostics:**
```bash
PW_DEBUG=no                # Enable debug logging (default: no)
```
HTTP access logs (one line per request) are only emitted when `PW_DEBUG` is
enabled — production logs stay quiet. The gateway **firmware version** is
logged at the first successful poll and again on every change
(`Gateway <id> firmware changed: X -> Y`), so `docker logs pypowerwall-server`
answers "when did my Powerwall firmware update?" without extra tooling.

**Timeouts:**
```bash
PW_TIMEOUT=10                # Local gateway request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
```
`PW_TIMEOUT` is the HTTP timeout pypowerwall uses for local gateway
connections (local, hybrid, TEDAPI full/v1r). Cloud and FleetAPI connections
use the library default (5 s). Each poll step waits `max(5, PW_TIMEOUT + 2)`
seconds (aggregates, vitals and strings: `max(10, PW_TIMEOUT + 2)`), so the
library times out before the server gives up on the worker thread, and a whole
poll is capped at `max(30, 3 × PW_CACHE_EXPIRE, 4 × (PW_TIMEOUT + 2))` seconds.
Raise it if a slow local gateway logs poll timeouts.

**Time-Series Storage (Daily Energy Stats):**
```bash
PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION=24h            # Raw 5s sample retention (default: 24h)
PW_TIMESERIES_DAILY_RETENTION=0        # Daily kWh aggregate retention (default: 0 = unlimited)
PW_TIMESERIES_PATH=/data/timeseries.db  # SQLite path (default: /data/timeseries.db if /data exists)
```
The server records every poll cycle's power readings to a local SQLite
store (WAL mode) and derives daily energy totals per gateway via trapezoidal
integration: solar, home consumption, battery charge/discharge, grid
import/export — each tracked directionally (never netted). Totals reset at
local midnight using each gateway's configured timezone, survive restarts,
and show in the web console's **Daily Energy** panel plus the
`/api/timeseries/*` endpoints. Raw samples also capture battery level
(state of charge) per poll — kept for the raw retention window only, never
downsampled into daily aggregates. Clicking the console's **Energy Summary**
panel toggles it into an **Energy Trend** view: the last 24 hours of raw
data charted as Solar/Home/Battery/Grid kW (shared left axis) plus Battery
Level % (dashed, right axis), using the standard color coding. Raw samples
are pruned to the retention
window (keeping the last hour for troubleshooting); daily aggregates are one
tiny row per gateway per day (~100 B/day) so unlimited retention is the
sensible default. Intervals longer than 1 hour (outage/gap) are never
integrated — no fabricated energy. Set `PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION=-1` to
disable the subsystem entirely for headless proxy deployments (no SQLite
file, no writes, UI panel hidden). Retention accepts `90s`, `48h`, `7d`,
`30d`, `365d` style values; `0` = unlimited.

### Configuration File (gateways.yaml)

Pass a YAML (or JSON) config file with `--config gateways.yaml` or
`PW_CONFIG=/path/to/gateways.yaml`. A template ships as
`gateways.yaml.example` — copy it to `gateways.yaml` (which is gitignored,
since it holds gateway passwords) and edit:

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8675
  cors_origins:
    - http://localhost:3000

gateways:
  - id: home
    name: Home System
    host: 192.168.91.1
    gw_pwd: gw_pwd_1
    email: tesla@email.com
    authpath: /auth
    timezone: America/Los_Angeles
    
  - id: cabin
    name: Cabin System
    host: 192.168.91.1
    gw_pwd: gw_pwd_2
    email: tesla@email.com
    authpath: /auth
    timezone: America/Denver

  - id: garage
    name: Garage (travel router)
    host: 192.168.1.50   # travel router IP
    port: 8443           # non-standard HTTPS port forwarded to 192.168.91.1
    gw_pwd: gw_pwd_3
    timezone: America/Los_Angeles

  - id: south-inverter
    name: South Array Inverter
    host: 192.168.91.1
    gw_pwd: gw_pwd_4
    type: inverter       # solar-only; suppresses battery panels in console
    timezone: America/Los_Angeles
    
  - id: cloud-site
    name: Cloud Mode Site
    email: user@example.com
    authpath: /auth
    cloud_mode: true

  - id: v1r-gateway
    name: TEDAPI v1r Gateway
    host: 192.168.91.1
    gw_pwd: your_gateway_password                # Required even in v1r mode (used to derive customer password)
    rsa_key_path: /keys/tedapi_rsa_private.pem  # RSA-4096 private key (TEDAPI v1r mode)
    wifi_host: 192.168.91.1                     # WiFi fallback IP (optional, defaults to 192.168.91.1)
    timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

**Authentication:**
- `gw_pwd`: For TEDAPI local gateway access (standard mode)
- `rsa_key_path`: Path to RSA-4096 private key PEM file for TEDAPI v1r LAN access (requires `gw_pwd` — the RSA key handles the encrypted channel, but `gw_pwd` is still needed to derive the customer password)
- `email` + `authpath`: For Tesla Cloud API (control operations)
  - Run `pypowerwall-server --setup` to authenticate and generate auth files
  - Specify directory containing `.pypowerwall.auth` and `.pypowerwall.site` files

**TEDAPI connection modes:**
- `host` + `gw_pwd` → TEDAPI (standard, uses gateway Wi-Fi password)
- `host` + `gw_pwd` + `rsa_key_path` → TEDAPI v1r (RSA-4096 encrypted channel + customer password from gw_pwd; shown as "TEDAPI v1r" in console)
- `host` + `gw_pwd` + `tedapi_auth_mode: bearer` → TEDAPI over the wired LAN IP (solar-only gateways only; shown as "TEDAPI (bearer)" in console)
- `wifi_host` → Optional WiFi fallback IP for v1r mode (default `192.168.91.1`; only needed when your gateway is on a non-standard IP)

**Optional fields:**
- `port`: Non-standard HTTPS port (e.g. `8443`) — use when the gateway is behind a travel router that forwards a custom port to `192.168.91.1:443`
- `type`: Gateway device type — `powerwall` (default, has batteries) or `inverter` (solar-only; suppresses battery panels in the console)
- `rsa_key_path`: RSA-4096 private key PEM path for TEDAPI v1r LAN authentication (requires `gw_pwd` — see above)
- `wifi_host`: WiFi host IP for TEDAPI v1r WiFi fallback (default `192.168.91.1`; set this when your gateway's WiFi AP is on a different subnet, e.g. behind a travel router)
- `tedapi_auth_mode`: TEDAPI auth transport — `basic` (gateway Wi-Fi AP, default) or `bearer` (wired LAN on solar-only gateways; not PW2 or PW3). Defaults to `PW_TEDAPI_AUTH_MODE`.
- `tedapi_api_version`: TEDAPI query set — `V2024_06` (default) or `V2026_06` (Tesla-signed queries; needs `protobuf >= 6.33.6`). Defaults to `PW_TEDAPI_API_VERSION`.
  - Precedence: per-gateway value → `PW_TEDAPI_*` environment default → library default. Unknown values log a warning and fall back (they never abort startup). pypowerwall only honours these in full TEDAPI mode (`host` + `gw_pwd`, no `password`); Basic LAN, hybrid (`gw_pwd` + `password`) and cloud gateways ignore them. `/stats` reports the requested and active values per gateway, so a request pypowerwall did not honour is visible there.

### Reverse Proxy / HTTPS Proxy

You can serve pypowerwall-server from a sub-path alongside other services (e.g. Grafana on `/`) using `PROXY_BASE_URL`. This is the recommended setup for HTTPS via nginx.

**Environment variable:**
```bash
PROXY_BASE_URL=/pypowerwall   # Serve everything under /pypowerwall/
```

With this set, all UI pages, static assets, and API calls are rendered with the correct prefix so the browser resolves them through the proxy. No changes to API clients are needed.

**Example nginx configuration:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name lab.lan;

    # Grafana at root
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://grafana:3000/;
    }

    # PyPowerwall at /pypowerwall/
    location /pypowerwall/ {
        # Strip the /pypowerwall prefix before forwarding (trailing slash is required)
        proxy_pass http://pypowerwall:8675/;

        proxy_set_header Host              $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host  $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port  $server_port;

        # Strip CORS headers added by pypowerwall so nginx can set its own

}
```

> **Note:** nginx's trailing slash in `proxy_pass http://pypowerwall:8675/;` strips the `/pypowerwall` prefix before forwarding requests to pypowerwall. The `PROXY_BASE_URL` setting is only used to generate correct browser-side URLs (asset paths, API URLs, redirects) — pypowerwall itself receives all requests without the prefix.

**URL mapping with this configuration:**

| Browser URL | Forwarded to pypowerwall as |
|---|---|
| `https://lab.lan/pypowerwall/` | `GET /` — Power Flow animation |
| `https://lab.lan/pypowerwall/console` | `GET /console` — Management console |
| `https://lab.lan/pypowerwall/api/...` | `GET /api/...` — API endpoints |
| `https://lab.lan/pypowerwall/static/...` | `GET /static/...` — Static assets |

### Rate Limiting

Optional per-client-IP request throttling, **disabled by default**. Most deployments sit behind [Powerwall-Dashboard](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard), Grafana, or Home Assistant, which poll many of the 113+ endpoints every 1-5 seconds — that's the primary use case, not something to be throttled away.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PW_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `no` | Enable per-IP rate limiting |
| `PW_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `1000` | Requests allowed per window, per client IP |
| `PW_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `60` | Length of the rate limit window, in seconds |
| `PW_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_BUCKETS` | `10000` | Max tracked client IPs before stale/oldest entries are pruned |

```bash
export PW_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=yes
export PW_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000   # ~16 req/s per IP, well above normal dashboard polling
export PW_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
```

Or via CLI: `pypowerwall-server --rate-limit --rate-limit-max-requests 1000 --rate-limit-window 60`

The default budget (1000 requests / 60s per IP) is set well above a normal dashboard's polling load, so it should not affect typical usage even when enabled. Requests over the limit receive `HTTP 429 {"detail": "Rate limit exceeded"}`.

**Caveats:**

- **Reverse proxies:** if pypowerwall-server sits behind a reverse proxy (see above), every client shares the proxy's IP address, so one rate-limit bucket applies collectively to *all* users behind that proxy. Size the limit accordingly, or rely on the proxy's own per-client rate limiting instead.
- **Internet-exposed deployments:** this server is designed to be bound to a LAN interface (`PW_BIND_ADDRESS`) behind your firewall — that's the default and recommended setup. If you do expose it to the internet, pair `PW_CONTROL_SECRET` (control endpoint auth) with rate limiting at a real reverse proxy (nginx `limit_req`, Traefik, Caddy) in front of pypowerwall-server. This in-process limiter runs after a connection is already accepted, so it does not protect against connection-level resource exhaustion.

## Console

The management console is at `/console` (the Power Flow animation is at `/`).

### Card Visibility and Kiosk Mode

Use **Cards** in the console header to show or hide individual cards; the remaining cards in a row widen to fill the space. **Kiosk** hides the header and status banner for a wall display or tablet. The status banner reappears if the server loses its gateway connection, so stale data is never shown without a warning. In kiosk mode, faint **Cards** and **Exit kiosk** buttons sit in the top-right corner (hover, tap or tab to them), and Esc exits. These choices are saved in the browser.

A kiosk browser can be configured by URL instead. URL parameters override the saved choices and are not saved:

```
http://<server>:8675/console?kiosk=1&hide=alerts,gateways,mqtt
```

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `kiosk=1` | Start in kiosk mode (`kiosk=0` forces it off) |
| `hide=<ids>` | Comma-separated cards to hide: `power-flow`, `energy`, `alerts`, `strings`, `health`, `control`, `powerwall`, `gateways`, `mqtt`, `daily-energy` |

With `PROXY_BASE_URL` set, include the prefix, e.g. `https://lab.lan/pypowerwall/console?kiosk=1&hide=gateways` (see [Reverse Proxy / HTTPS Proxy](#reverse-proxy--https-proxy)).

For a Raspberry Pi display:

```bash
chromium-browser --kiosk --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars \
  "http://localhost:8675/console?kiosk=1&hide=gateways,mqtt"
```

## MQTT Integration

Set `MQTT_HOST` to enable publishing. All other variables are optional.

```bash
export MQTT_HOST=192.168.1.100       # broker IP — required to enable MQTT
export MQTT_PORT=1883                # default: 1883
export MQTT_USERNAME=mqttuser        # optional
export MQTT_PASSWORD=mqttpassword    # optional
export MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY=true        # auto-configure Home Assistant sensors (default: true)
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MQTT_HOST` | *(none)* | Broker hostname/IP. **Required to enable MQTT.** |
| `MQTT_PORT` | `1883` | Broker port |
| `MQTT_USERNAME` | *(none)* | Username for authentication |
| `MQTT_PASSWORD` | *(none)* | Password for authentication |
| `MQTT_TLS` | `false` | Enable TLS/SSL |
| `MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT` | *(none)* | Path to CA certificate |
| `MQTT_TLS_INSECURE` | `false` | Disable cert verification (testing only) |
| `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX` | `pypowerwall` | Root topic prefix |
| `MQTT_RETAIN` | `true` | Retain messages on broker |
| `MQTT_QOS` | `1` | MQTT QoS level (0, 1, or 2) |
| `MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY` | `true` | Publish Home Assistant auto-discovery payloads |
| `MQTT_HA_PREFIX` | `homeassistant` | HA discovery prefix |
| `MQTT_CLIENT_ID` | `pypowerwall-server` | MQTT client identifier |
| `MQTT_KEEPALIVE` | `60` | Connection keepalive in seconds |

Topics are published under `{MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX}/{gateway_id}/` — e.g. `pypowerwall/default/battery`, `pypowerwall/default/solar`, etc. See [mqtt-tools/README.md](mqtt-tools/README.md) for the full topic list, broker setup guide, Home Assistant integration steps, and the live monitor GUI.

## API Endpoints

### Legacy Proxy Compatibility

All existing proxy endpoints work unchanged:

**Core Data Endpoints:**
- `GET /vitals` - Detailed system vitals
- `GET /aggregates` - Power meter aggregates
- `GET /soe` - State of energy (battery %)
- `GET /freq` - Grid frequency data
- `GET /pod` - Battery pod details
- `GET /strings` - Solar string data

- `GET /alerts/pw` - Powerwall alerts only

**Fan Information:**
- `GET /fans` - All fan status
- `GET /fans/pw` - Powerwall fans only (`FANn_actual`/`FANn_target` RPM; Powerwall 3 adds `FANn_duty` %, with `FANn_target` null)

**Data Export:**
- `GET /csv` - CSV format for Telegraf/InfluxDB
- `GET /csv/v2` - Enhanced CSV format

**TEDAPI Raw Access:**
- `GET /tedapi` - TEDAPI endpoint list
- `GET /tedapi/config` - Gateway configuration
- `GET /tedapi/status` - System status
- `GET /tedapi/components` - Component details
- `GET /tedapi/battery` - Battery information
- `GET /tedapi/controller` - Controller data

**Tesla API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/system_status/soe` - State of energy
- `GET /api/system_status/grid_status` - Grid connection status
- `GET /api/system_status/grid_faults` - Grid fault log
- `GET /api/sitemaster` - Sitemaster information
- `GET /api/meters/aggregates` - Power meters
- `GET /api/status` - System status
- `GET /api/site_info` - Site information
- `GET /api/site_info/site_name` - Site name
- `GET /api/customer/registration` - Customer registration info
- `GET /api/troubleshooting/problems` - Problem list
- `GET /api/auth/toggle/supported` - Auth toggle support
- `GET /api/networks` - Network configuration
- `GET /api/system/networks` - System networks
- `GET /api/powerwalls` - Powerwall device list

**Server Status:**
- `GET /version` - Server and firmware versions
- `GET /stats` - Server statistics (uptime, requests, errors)

**Control Operations (requires authentication):**
- `GET /control/status` - Control availability for the Console (`{"enabled": bool}`, unauthenticated)
- `POST /control/{path}` - Control operations (reserve, mode, etc.)

**Tesla Tariff (server-only, not in the pypowerwall proxy):**
- `GET /api/tesla/tariff_rate` - The site's utility tariff from the Tesla cloud
  (`code`, `name`, `utility`, `seasons`, `energy_charges`, ...). Cached for 5
  minutes; if a refresh fails, the last good tariff is served.
- `POST /api/tesla/time_of_use_settings` - Update the Time-of-Use tariff
  (requires `Authorization: Bearer <PW_CONTROL_SECRET>`). Body:
  `{"tou_settings": {"optimization_strategy": "economics", "tariff_content_v2": {...}}}`.
  Only `tou_settings` is sent to Tesla. `tariff_content_v2` uses Tesla's v2
  tariff schema, which differs from what the GET returns, so a read result
  can't be posted back unchanged. Returns e.g. `{"Message": "Updated", "Code": 201}`.

Both need a Tesla cloud connection: hybrid mode (a local gateway with
`PW_EMAIL` cloud control), or a cloud or FleetAPI gateway. Otherwise they
return `503`; a Tesla-side error returns `502`, and an invalid POST body `400`.

- `GET /api/gateways/{id}` - Gateway details
- `GET /api/gateways/{id}/vitals` - Gateway-specific vitals
- `GET /api/gateways/{id}/aggregates` - Gateway-specific power data

**Aggregated Data:**
- `GET /api/aggregate/power` - Combined power across all gateways
- `GET /api/aggregate/soe` - Total battery capacity and charge
- `GET /api/aggregate/status` - Health status of all gateways

- `GET /api/timeseries/status` - Subsystem status, retention settings, DB size

All report `{"enabled": false, ...}` when disabled (`PW_TIMESERIES_RETENTION=-1`).

**WebSocket Endpoints:**
- `WS /ws/gateway/{id}` - Real-time data stream for specific gateway
- `WS /ws/aggregate` - Real-time aggregated data stream

## Design

### Cloud Authentication with Auth Tokens

The server supports **Tesla Cloud authentication** for control operations:

**TEDAPI (Local)**: For fast data reads from `192.168.91.1`
- Requires: `host` + `password` (gateway password)
- Fast response times (local network)
- No internet dependency
- Used for monitoring metrics

**Cloud (Control)**: For control operations via Tesla API
- Requires: `email` + `authpath`
- Setup: Run `pypowerwall-server --setup` to authenticate
- Generates: `.pypowerwall.auth` and `.pypowerwall.site` token files
- Used for: Setting reserve level, operating mode, etc.

**Configuration:**
```bash
# TEDAPI only (monitoring)
PW_HOST=192.168.91.1
PW_GW_PWD=gateway_password

# TEDAPI + Cloud (monitoring + control)
PW_HOST=192.168.91.1
PW_GW_PWD=gateway_password
PW_EMAIL=tesla@email.com
PW_AUTH_PATH=/path/to/auth  # Directory with .pypowerwall.auth/.site files
```

### Async + Sync Library Integration
FastAPI is async, but pypowerwall is synchronous. This is handled using `asyncio.run_in_executor()` to run blocking pypowerwall calls in thread pools, preventing event loop blocking.

### Stateless Server Architecture
The server maintains no persistent state or historical data. All historical data for graphs is stored in **browser localStorage**, allowing:
- Server restarts without data loss (data persists in browser)
- Horizontal scaling (no shared state required)
- Minimal server resource usage
- Simple deployment model

### Control Features & Security
**Default: Read-only** - The server operates in monitoring mode by default.

**Optional Control Mode**: Enable by setting the control secret:
```bash
PW_CONTROL_SECRET=your-secure-random-token
```

When control is enabled:
- All control operations require authentication via token
- Token must be sent in the `Authorization` header (plain or `Bearer <token>`)
- Applies to `/control/*` and the per-gateway POST proxy
  (`POST /api/gateways/{id}/api/*`)
- When `PW_CONTROL_SECRET` is not set, all write endpoints return 403

**Calling the control API:**

```bash
TOKEN=$PW_CONTROL_SECRET

# Set backup reserve to 20%
curl -X POST http://localhost:8675/control/reserve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 20}'

# Set operating mode (self_consumption, backup, autonomous)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8675/control/mode \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "self_consumption"}'

# Set mode + reserve in one call (companion parameter)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8675/control/mode \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "self_consumption", "level": 20}'
```

> **Note on reserve 0:** changing the operating mode together with a reserve
> level of `0` is applied by Tesla's cloud API as two separate commands, and
> the mode change can be silently dropped (HTTP 200, but the mode doesn't
> stick). If you need mode + reserve 0, set the mode with the *current* reserve
> level first, then set the reserve to `0` in a separate call.

**Islanding (local PW3 v1r/TEDAPI):** `POST /control/islanding` uses the same
control token and targets the default gateway (the gateway named `default`,
otherwise the first configured gateway). It requires a registered v1r RSA key
and pypowerwall 0.17.3 or later. It uses the gateway's local connection even in
hybrid mode; it does not fall back to cloud control. Other control routes are
unchanged.

| JSON body | Library call |
|-----------|--------------|
| `{"value": "off_grid", "confirm": true}` | `go_off_grid(confirm=True)` |
| `{"value": "on_grid"}` | `reconnect_grid()` |

`value` must match exactly. Off-grid requires the JSON boolean `true` for
`confirm`, not a string or number. If supplied for either operation, `confirm`
must be a boolean. Invalid values return HTTP 400; malformed JSON or a body
that is not an object returns FastAPI's HTTP 422 validation error.

The response preserves the library's `mode`, `force`, and `result` fields.
HTTP 200 requires `result: 1`, the acknowledgement observed on real PW3
hardware. Other or missing result codes return HTTP 502 with the library
response in `detail.response`; unavailable/unsupported connections, exceptions,
or no response within the existing control timeout return HTTP 503.

**Server-side cooldown:** islanding commands are rate limited per gateway —
after any dispatch (including failures and timeouts, since the gateway may
still have acted), further islanding commands return HTTP 429 with a
`Retry-After` header until `PW_ISLANDING_COOLDOWN` seconds have passed
(default: 30; `0` disables). A command still in flight returns HTTP 409.
This is enforced for **all** clients — curl, automations, and the Console
alike — so a misbehaving script cannot rapidly toggle the grid contactor.

⚠️ **WARNING — Grid island control physically operates your home's grid
contactor. Use with extreme care.** Going off-grid can interrupt power and
temporarily interrupt solar production. While islanded, Powerwall may raise the
home's electrical frequency to limit or stop solar production, particularly
when the battery is near full or available charging capacity is limited. This
can cause lights to flicker and affect frequency-sensitive equipment.

Your home depends on available battery and solar power while disconnected from
the grid; if those cannot support the load, your home can lose power. Do not
assume that a nearly full battery guarantees a seamless transition.

Do not automate these commands without understanding the failure modes; test
only when someone is present. An acknowledgement is not confirmation that the
home changed grid state: check `GET /api/system_status/grid_status` after the
transition, allowing for the configured polling interval. After an error or
timeout, the outcome may be unknown and the command may still complete; do not
automatically retry or send the opposite command.

**Web Console (`/console`):** when `PW_CONTROL_SECRET` is set, the Console shows
a *Powerwall Control* card (after System Health) grouped into bordered
sub-panels: **Authorization Token** (kept in the tab by default; optional
“Remember my token on this device” persists it in `localStorage`; sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` per request), **Operating Mode** and **Battery**
side by side (a mode radio group—Self-Consumption/Backup/Time-Based—and the
backup reserve slider + number, 0–100), and **Grid** (grid connection status, a
grid charging toggle, a grid export radio group—Everything/Solar/Never, labeled
to match the Tesla app; the API values remain `battery_ok`/`pv_only`/`never`—
and the Go Off Grid/Reconnect Grid action in the same row, kept in its own
highlighted panel since it is the one destructive control). Each control always
reflects the live state — there is no separate "Now:" readout — and a control
the user just changed stays highlighted until the next poll confirms the
gateway applied it.
Availability is checked via unauthenticated `GET /control/status`
(`{"enabled": bool}`); current values come from `GET /api/operation` (which
also reports `grid_charging` and `grid_export`, `null` when unavailable e.g.
TEDAPI-only without
cloud). One Save
button sends a single combined `POST /control/mode {"value": mode, "level":
reserve}` when both changed (reserve 0 + mode change is auto-split into two
calls, see note above), otherwise a single `/control/reserve` or `/control/mode`
call, plus separate `POST /control/grid_charging {"value": true/false}` and
`POST /control/grid_export {"value": "battery_ok"|"pv_only"|"never"}` calls when
grid charging or export changed. Controls the default gateway.

**Grid charging / export eligibility:** enabling grid charging, or moving grid
export from *Never* to an exporting option, pops a confirmation dialog and has
an info icon for reference. Enable grid export only when your utility has
approved your system to export electricity — often called *Permission to
Operate* (PTO). Only enable grid charging if your utility rate plan and local
rules allow it. If you claim the U.S. federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC):
batteries placed in service before 2023 were required to charge exclusively
from solar, and the Inflation Reduction Act removed that restriction for
systems placed in service from 2023 on — verify how grid charging affects
your credit before enabling it. Rules for residential battery storage —
grid charging, grid export, and system operation — also differ between
countries and regions (for example, between EU Member States and their
local grid-connection requirements). pypowerwall-server does not determine
or enforce regulatory compliance: you are responsible for ensuring that
your configuration and use of these controls complies with the regulations
applicable to your installation and jurisdiction. Reference links:
[IRS Residential Clean Energy Credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit)
and [DSIRE](https://www.dsireusa.org/) for state/local incentives and rules.

For a local PW3 v1r/TEDAPI gateway, the card also shows the cached grid state
and enables exactly one islanding action: **Go Off Grid** while connected or
**Reconnect Grid** while islanded. The islanding section is hidden entirely
on gateways without a local v1r connection. Each action requires a browser confirmation.
After any request, both islanding controls are locked for one minute, including
after an error or timeout, because the outcome may be unknown. Use **Refresh
Grid Status** and verify the reported state after the polling interval; an
acknowledgement is not proof that the contactor changed state.

### Data Aggregation Strategy
Multi-gateway aggregation uses **smart aggregation** that will evolve over time:

Current implementation (v0.1.x):
- Battery %: Simple average (TODO: weighted by capacity)
- Power flows: Simple sum (works for independent systems)
- Grid power: Calculated as site - solar

Future considerations documented in code:
- Capacity-weighted averages
- Different strategies per metric type
- Handling mixed local/cloud gateways
- Time synchronization across gateways
- Outlier detection

This area is expected to need tuning as real-world multi-gateway deployments provide feedback.

### Performance & Caching
- **Polling interval**: 5 seconds (configurable)
- **WebSocket updates**: Real-time to UI (1-second interval)
- **No server-side caching**: Fresh data on every request
- **Browser caching**: Historical data in localStorage

### UI Framework
Vanilla JavaScript - lightweight, no build step, fast loading. Charts and advanced features can be added incrementally without framework overhead.

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run development server with auto-reload
#
#   Local TEDAPI Mode
PW_GW_PWD=ABCDEFGHIJ ./run.sh uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8675
#
#   Cloud Mode
pypowerwall-server --setup # create .pypowerwall.auth
PW_EMAIL="your@emal.com" PW_HOST= uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8675

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```

CI (GitHub Actions) runs the pytest suite on Python 3.10–3.12 and a
`js-syntax` job that extracts every inline `<script>` block from
`app/static/**/*.html` and validates it with `node --check`, so a syntax
error in the Console's inline JavaScript fails the build instead of silently
breaking the web UI.

### Building Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t pypowerwall-server .
docker run -p 8675:8675 pypowerwall-server
```

## Performance

The server is designed for efficiency with background polling and caching:

- **Cached Responses** - API endpoints return instantly from cache (no pypowerwall blocking)
- **Background Polling** - Default 5-second interval (configurable via PW_CACHE_EXPIRE)
- **Thread Pool** - Sized dynamically: max(10, num_gateways * 3) workers
- **WebSocket Updates** - Push data every 1 second to connected clients
- **Graceful Degradation** - Serves last known good data when gateways are offline
- **Concurrent Gateway Polling** - All gateways polled in parallel using asyncio

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework
- **Uvicorn** - Lightning-fast ASGI server
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and settings management
- **pypowerwall** - Core Powerwall communication library
- **aiohttp** - Async HTTP client for concurrent gateway polling
- **WebSockets** - Real-time data streaming
- **Modern UI** - HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
